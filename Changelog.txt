-- About WmDOT ----------------------------------------------------------------
WmDOT (short for "William's Department of Transportation") is an AI for
    OpenTTD, a freeware clone of Chris Saywer's Transport Tycoon Deluxe. Having
    fallen in love with the original, I was quite delighted to find the
    remake! Of the things that has been added to OpenTTD is custom AI's, of
    which this is one. For me, it's a way to back in touch with a game I fell
    in love with years ago and to brush up on my programming skills at the same
    time.

For full details on WmDOT, see the attached README.txt

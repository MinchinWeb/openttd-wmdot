.
r70	2011-04-13	v5 Based on r70
				Large map issue considered resolved
					Fixed issue 14
r69	2011-04-13	Adjust Pathfinder wieghts (too many bridges, not enough road
					reuse) (both still issues...)
				[TownRegistrar] Old Neighbourhoods are now deleted when new
					ones are generated
				[OpDOT] To check if a path was built, checking the build cost
					after trying to build it the first time
r64	2011-04-12	Improve debug crash strings
				[OpDOT] Add setting to change number of rebuild attempts
r53f 2011-04-09	[OpDOT] Allow use of neighbourhoods for Mode 1 (connect all
					towns close to capital, regardless of population)
				[OpDOT] In Mode 7, increase population limit and send DOT back
					to Mode 3 with the new Atlas (allows connecting to higher
					population centers across the map)
				[OpLog] DebugLevel 5 now available to put signs on the map
				[TownRegistrar] Commented out TN and NN links
				[TownRegistrar] UpdateMode introduced (for OpDOT Mode 1 and 7)
				[OpDOT] merged Mode 6 in Mode 1-5 cases
r53e 2011-04-09	[Fibonacci Heap] introduced, base on NoAI Team's v2 library
r53d 2011-04-09	[Pathfinder] Parameter refinements to decrease bridge building
					and encourage reusing exisiting roads
				[TownRegistrar] RegisterConnection
				[Arrays] Added null array check to ContainedIn1DArray and
					ContainedIn2DArray functions
r53c 2011-04-09	[Neighbourhoods] Impromvements to debuging output
r53b 2011-04-09	[TownRegistrar] Splits large neighbourhoods based on a
					bisecting line between the two largest towns in the
					original neighbourhood
r53a 2011-04-08	[TownRegistrar] introduced
				Post-initialization cross-class linking implemented
v4	2011-04-09	Version 4 release, based on r52d
r52d 2011-04-08	[OpDOT] Added escape if the pathfinder returns null	
r52c 2011-04-08	Added Readme.txt	
r52b 2011-04-08	[OpDOT] Added path check to Mode 6	
r52a 2011-04-08	[OpDOT] Replaced path check buy just refinding the original
					road and considering it built if the BuiltCost == 0
				Confirmed fixed 'Crash on Load Game' bug present in v3
...	
r42	2011-03-26	[A*] Moved A* pathfinder inhouse, base on NoAI's AyStar v4
					and v6
				- requires "binary_heap" library v.1
r41	2011-03-26	Move to 'Operation' Paradigm complete
					- Operation DOT (existing process)
					- Operation Money (Loan management)
					- Operation Log (Debugging Output)
				Changes to AI Options dialogue to reflect new framework
r40	2011-03-25	v3
r39 2011-03-25	Move road pathfinder from library to .nut file to make
					installation easier	
r38	2011-03-25	Move existing 'DOT' code to OpDOT.nut to facilitate move to
					'operations'
r33	2011-03-24	v2 - Initial Bananas Release
				Company no longer renames itself on savegame reloading
r17	2011-03-01	Now generates the Atlas once per Mode (as opposed for each new
					route) and then build all possible routes
				- Moved existing route checking from Atlas generation to
					on-demand
				- Now maintains a list of routes that have been tested and 
					found to exist
				Seperated Array functions
				Add more loan management points
r16	2011-02-25	Road Pathfinder optimization
				- now considered v4 of pathfinder
				- added a couple of lines to the pathfinder to allow it to
					ignore non connected road tiles (used for searching for
					already connected towns). This improves search time from
					about 80-100 ticks/route to 40 ticks/route in the
					'Remove Existing Connections' function
r15	2011-02-24	Multiply DOT's running at the same time now run in a
					semi-cooperative fashion by building HQ in different cities
				HQInWhatTown(CompanyNo)
				TileIsWhatTown(TileIn)
r14	2011-02-19	Build out in zones (speed, quarter map, full map)
				Build out in steps (capital, connected towns)
				- combination moves up to six Modes	
v1				(to be released based on r11...never happened...)
r11	2011-02-18	Introduces Loan Management
				- requires SuperLib v6
				- keeps a minimum amount of money on hand
				- maxes out the loan to build any link and then pays it back
r5b	2011-02-18	Keeps track of already built connections
				Introduces 'Modes'
					Mode 1 tries to connect all the towns above the population threshold
					Mode 2 considers (and builds) alternate connections
					Mode 3 is 'nap' mode
				Seperated out GNU FDL code
				Clean up of Debug output
r4b	2011-02-17	r9 is uploaded to Google Code
r9	2011-02-12	Computes only half of the matrix (computational savings of 45%
					in test case)
				No more crashes upon building all the connects
r8	2011-02-11	This is the first version that 'works'. It selects a list of
					towns, weighs them based on distance and populaiton, and
					then builds connections. However, it can be VERY slow and
					crashes once everything is connected!
				Requires RoadPathfinder, v.3
				RemoveExistingConnections(WmAtlas)
				BuildRoad(path)
				- from NoAI Wiki
r7	2011-02-10	PickTowns()
				- picks the towns to connect (Trip Generation, Trip Distribution)
				NameWmDOT()
				- President now gets title of 'P.Eng'
r6	2011-02-09	BuildWmHQ()
				- picks biggest town and builds HQ
r4				GenerateAtlas()
r3				GenerateTownList()
				- uses cut-off population given in settings
				NameWmDOT()

Roadmap:
- move array functions to library
- improve route selection by estimating cost based on building cost rather than pure distance
- move to grid based route finding
	- generate 'gateways' for each town
	- do route finding one grid spacing at a 
- rewrite build path sequence so I can call it my own
- figure out how to get the version number to show up in Start()
- check the town centres are actually roads (use AIRoad::IsRoadTile() )
- add license file - http://opensource.org/licenses/qtpl ?
- generally impove the speed of the pathfinder
- somehow allow a 'connectioned' matrix to be built based on the array of built connections

Issues
- can't built bridges from the flat (like for over railway tracks)
- Funds Request fails if greater than the maximum loan amount

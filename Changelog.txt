== About WmDOT ===========================================================
WmDOT (short for "William's Department of Transportation") is an AI for
    OpenTTD, a freeware clone of Chris Saywer's Transport Tycoon Deluxe.
    Having fallen in love with the original, I was quite delighted to find
    the remake! Of the things that has been added to OpenTTD is custom
    AI's, of which this is one. For me, it's a way to back in touch with a
    game I fell in love with years ago and to brush up on my programming
    skills at the same time.

For full details on WmDOT, see the attached README.txt

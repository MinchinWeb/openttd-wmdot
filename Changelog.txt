r42	2011-03-26	[A*] Moved A* pathfinder inhouse, base on NoAI's AyStar v4
					and v6
				- requires "binary_heap" library v.1
r41	2011-03-26	Move to 'Operation' Paradigm complete
					- Operation DOT (existing process)
					- Operation Money (Loan management)
					- Operation Log (Debugging Output)
				Changes to AI Options dialogue to reflect new framework
r40	2011-03-25	v3
r39 2011-03-25	Move road pathfinder from library to .nut file to make
					installation easier	
r38	2011-03-25	Move existing 'DOT' code to OpDOT.nut to facilitate move to
					'operations'
r33	2011-03-24	v2 - Initial Bananas Release
				Company no longer renames itself on savegame reloading
r17	2011-03-01	Now generates the Atlas once per Mode (as opposed for each new
					route) and then build all possible routes
				- Moved existing route checking from Atlas generation to
					on-demand
				- Now maintains a list of routes that have been tested and 
					found to exist
				Seperated Array functions
				Add more loan management points
r16	2011-02-25	Road Pathfinder optimization
				- now considered v4 of pathfinder
				- added a couple of lines to the pathfinder to allow it to
					ignore non connected road tiles (used for searching for
					already connected towns). This improves search time from
					about 80-100 ticks/route to 40 ticks/route in the
					'Remove Existing Connections' function
r15	2011-02-24	Multiply DOT's running at the same time now run in a
					semi-cooperative fashion by building HQ in different cities
				HQInWhatTown(CompanyNo)
				TileIsWhatTown(TileIn)
r14	2011-02-19	Build out in zones (speed, quarter map, full map)
				Build out in steps (capital, connected towns)
				- combination moves up to six Modes	
v1				(to be released based on r11...never happened...)
r11	2011-02-18	Introduces Loan Management
				- requires SuperLib v6
				- keeps a minimum amount of money on hand
				- maxes out the loan to build any link and then pays it back
r5b	2011-02-18	Keeps track of already built connections
				Introduces 'Modes'
					Mode 1 tries to connect all the towns above the population threshold
					Mode 2 considers (and builds) alternate connections
					Mode 3 is 'nap' mode
				Seperated out GNU FDL code
				Clean up of Debug output
r4b	2011-02-17	r9 is uploaded to Google Code
r9	2011-02-12	Computes only half of the matrix (computational savings of 45%
					in test case)
				No more crashes upon building all the connects
r8	2011-02-11	This is the first version that 'works'. It selects a list of
					towns, weighs them based on distance and populaiton, and
					then builds connections. However, it can be VERY slow and
					crashes once everything is connected!
				Requires RoadPathfinder, v.3
				RemoveExistingConnections(WmAtlas)
				BuildRoad(path)
				- from NoAI Wiki
r7	2011-02-10	PickTowns()
				- picks the towns to connect (Trip Generation, Trip Distribution)
				NameWmDOT()
				- President now gets title of 'P.Eng'
r6	2011-02-09	BuildWmHQ()
				- picks biggest town and builds HQ
r4				GenerateAtlas()
r3				GenerateTownList()
				- uses cut-off population given in settings
				NameWmDOT()

Roadmap:
- move array functions to library
- improve route selection by estimating cost based on building cost rather than pure distance
- move to grid based route finding
	- generate 'gateways' for each town
	- do route finding one grid spacing at a 
- rewrite build path sequence so I can call it my own
- figure out how to get the version number to show up in Start()
- check the town centres are actually roads (use AIRoad::IsRoadTile() )
- add license file - http://opensource.org/licenses/qtpl ?
- generally impove the speed of the pathfinder
- rename and add pathfinder to main folder
- somehow allow a 'connectioned' matrix to be built based on the array of built connections
